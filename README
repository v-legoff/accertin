Welcome to Accertin
===================

This project is a fork from Lyntin, or, rather, from Access Lyntin,
which itself is a fork of Lyntin.  These projects (Access Lyntin
and Accertin) are designed to allow a user with a screen reader
to quickly navigate with a Lyntin MUD Client.

Main features are:
    Use wxPython instead of Tk for a GUI (Access Lyntin)
    Use the ScreenReaderAPI DLL to send datas to the screen reader
